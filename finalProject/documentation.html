    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My intended audience is mostly Liz, but if I end up liking how this turns out, then I might try to put it in my portfolio. My goal would be to just have it available on desktop/laptop for Liz and just a message on mobile that says to view it on a bigger screen. If I were to put it in my portfolio, I don’t think I will really need to change anything because most people will be looking at it on a laptop, and I don’t think it is such an essential part of my portfolio that it needs to be available on all platforms.</p>

    <h2>Style</h2>
    <p>I really wanted to focus on making realistic animals and have a progression of animals in each page. I wanted it to be playful and fun, so I chose the Londrina typeface from google fonts. I made sure to use white and grey for the words so as not to take away from the animals and to be contrasted enough with the black background. I also chose black as a background because of the white used in many of the animals. I was also inspired by a lot of interactive sites that use black backgrounds to make the content pop. I decided to make simple svg mouths for simplicitie's sake, but also for a bit of humor because of its juxtaposition to the realistic animals.</p>
    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>The only thing I did not create myself are the svg code which I got from illustrator after creating the shapes myself.</p>
    <h2>Libraries/Research</h2>
    <p>I learned how to use sound in javascript, as well as how to use the set timeout function which allows for there to be a delay in anything taking place. I used this to control the amount of time the mouth was open for each animal. I tried to use velocity.js, animate.js, and the general animate function of jQuery, but they all ended up to be much more complicated for what I wanted to do. I originally was trying to do a hover and/or create some sort of shaking animation to the animals, but I decided I didn't have enough time and instead focused on the svg appearing/disappearing and sound.</p>
