        <p class="description">Clue is a period tracking app that I use all the time. I decided to redesign this app because it was designed very well in terms of usage, and I could see tons of potential in giving it multiple different styles. This was the final style I came up with, which is very elegant and girly, which is something very out of my comfort zone. Because of that, I am very happy with how it turned out.</p>
