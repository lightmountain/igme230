        <p class="description">These posters were made in my first graphic design class, where we had to make posters for a designer who was having an exhibition at RIT. I chose Andy Warhol because I have grown up hearing about him my whole life, as I am from Pittsburgh just like him. I wanted to make sure it was something he would actually approve of, meaning I wasn't affraid to copy and repurpose much of his art, which is exactly what I did.</p>
