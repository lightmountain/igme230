<p id="verse1">I saw the the little portion of my generation destroyed,<br>
How I mourned the buttocks.<br>
Jump.<br>
Why is its jiggle so little?</p>

<p id="verse2">Just like a hump, is the rump.<br>
Rump - the true source of jiggle.</p>

<p id="verse3">All that is small is not rump,<br>
rump, by all account is big.<br>
"Jiggle", said the rump,<br>
And "jiggle" then "jiggle" again.</p>

<p id="verse4">How happy is the fat tush!<br>
Bangin.<br>
Why is it so fat?</p>

<p id="verse5">I cannot help but stop and look at the cunning cheek.<br>
Smack. smack, smack.</p>

<p id="verse6">Why would you think the bum is thin?<br>
the bum is the most thick disagreeable person of all.<br>
Never forget the thickset and stringy bum.</p>
